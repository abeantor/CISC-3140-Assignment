Assignment 5 - Linux Terminal Command Practice
Professor: Katherine Chuang

Description
1. Filter 1 column from a CSV file. Extract out the artist names from the CSV file that can be downloaded from the Spotify Charts website (https://spotifycharts.com/regional). Ensure that the artist names are unique and sorted. Retain the header as the top of the file.

To do this problem in terminal I had to download the file from the Spotify and saved as ListOfArtist.csv in my document. There were very limited reference i found out. So, this is what I did in terminal to achieve this goal.
  
Antors-Desktop:~ antor$ cd desktop
Antors-Desktop:~ antor$ ls
  Assignement1 report.docx		ListOfArtist.csv
Then I used the Cat command for get access to the CSV file by using : "cat ListOfArtist.csv". Then i use the command cat  "sort artist.csv" to sort the file to alapabethic order. Finally, I used "sort -u myfile.csv -o myfile.csv" command to sort only the unique value.
